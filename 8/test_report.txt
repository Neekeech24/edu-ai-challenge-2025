## Test Suite Summary
- Total Test Suites: 1
- Total Tests: 12
- All tests passing
- Test execution time: 1.671s

## Areas for Improvement
1. Add tests for Number Validator's positive(), negative(), and integer() methods
2. Increase coverage of Object Validator's strict mode functionality
3. Add tests for String Validator's nonEmpty() method
4. Add more edge cases and boundary testing

## Conclusion
The validation library has good overall coverage with most core functionality well-tested. Some advanced features and edge cases need additional test coverage, but the library is stable and ready for basic use cases.
