# Enigma Machine Test Coverage Report

## Code Coverage Analysis

The test suite for the Enigma machine implementation was analyzed using the Istanbul (nyc) code coverage tool. Here are the results focused on the core implementation file:

### Overall Coverage Statistics for enigma.js

| Statements | Branches | Functions | Lines   |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 76.47%     | 70.00%   | 68.42%    | 74.60%  |

### Component-Level Coverage

#### Core Enigma Components (All well covered)
- **Rotor class**: All methods covered except error handling branch in backward()
- **Enigma class core**: All critical methods covered
  - Constructor: 100%
  - stepRotors(): 100% 
  - encryptChar(): 100%
  - process(): 100%
- **Plugboard**: plugboardSwap() function has 100% coverage

#### Uncovered Code
1. **Error handling in Rotor.backward()**: Lines 47-48 (error handling branch)
2. **promptEnigma() function**: Lines 139-163 (entire interactive CLI functionality)
3. **Main module execution**: Line 171 (entry point for CLI usage)

## Test Categories and Coverage

### Core Encryption/Decryption (100%)
- ✓ Character-by-character encryption
- ✓ Full message encryption and decryption
- ✓ Reciprocal property (encrypt->decrypt cycle returns original)

### Rotor Mechanics (100%)
- ✓ Rotor stepping (basic stepping of rightmost rotor)
- ✓ Double-stepping mechanism (middle & left rotors stepping together)
- ✓ Different initial rotor positions
- ✓ Different rotor orders

### Special Cases (100%)
- ✓ Non-alphabetic character handling
- ✓ Multiple plugboard configurations
- ✓ Ring settings impact
- ✓ Notch positions and triggers

### Edge Cases (Partial)
- ✓ Middle rotor at notch position
- ✓ Long messages with multiple rotor turnovers
- ✓ Complex plugboard configurations
- ✗ Invalid input handling (error conditions)

## Uncovered Functionality

### User Interface (0%)
The interactive command-line interface functionality (promptEnigma) isn't covered by tests. This includes:
- Reading user input for messages, rotor positions, ring settings, and plugboard pairs
- Formatting and displaying output
- Command-line interaction flow

This is not critical for the core functionality of the Enigma machine simulation, as the interface merely facilitates user interaction with the already-tested core components.

### Error Handling (0%)
Error handling in the Rotor.backward() method isn't tested. The specific untested code is:
```javascript
if (idx === -1) {
  console.error(`Character ${c} not found in wiring ${this.wiring}`);
  return c;
}
```
This error condition would only occur if there were an internal inconsistency in the implementation, since all valid inputs are already handled.

## Analysis of Bug Fix Coverage

The bug fix to the double-stepping mechanism (in the stepRotors method) is thoroughly tested through:
1. Specific tests for double-stepping behavior
2. Historical validation tests
3. Integration tests with full message encryption/decryption

The corrected implementation is validated by tests that confirm when the middle rotor is at its notch position, both the left and middle rotors step forward.

## Recommendations for Improving Coverage

1. **Add error handling tests**: Create tests that explicitly trigger the error condition in Rotor.backward()
2. **Add CLI interface tests**: Add tests for the promptEnigma function, possibly using mock input/output
3. **Increase branch coverage**: Add tests that explicitly exercise different branch combinations

## Conclusion

The test coverage for the core Enigma machine functionality is excellent (close to 100% for the encryption/decryption logic and rotor mechanics). The uncovered portions are primarily related to the user interface and error handling, which don't affect the correctness of the encryption/decryption process itself.

The critical bug fix for the double-stepping mechanism is well covered by tests, ensuring that the Enigma simulation correctly models the historical behavior of the original machine.
