I'll analyze both feedback samples using chain-of-thought reasoning to determine relevance and extract key insights.
Sample 1 Analysis:
This feedback discusses a critical technical issue (sensor tracking problems) and quality control problems (defective dongle). The user mentions specific technical details (8000hz polling rate, wired vs wireless testing) and price context ($150), indicating they're discussing a gaming mouse product. This is clearly relevant product feedback about core functionality failures.
Sample 2 Analysis:
This feedback provides a nuanced evaluation of product value proposition. The user acknowledges the product has "no flaws" but questions its price-to-performance ratio compared to alternatives. This is relevant feedback about pricing strategy and market positioning, though somewhat general.
Here are the JSON analyses:
