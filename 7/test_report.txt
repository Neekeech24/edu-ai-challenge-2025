## Summary
All tests passed successfully, and coverage exceeds the required 60% threshold across all metrics. The codebase demonstrates good test coverage of core functionality, with particularly strong coverage of the Ship and Player classes.

The modular architecture of the codebase has made it easier to test individual components in isolation, contributing to the high coverage percentages achieved.
