A 25-year-old healthy engineering student and part-time postman presents with sharp chest pain localized over the heart, starting three days ago. The pain lasts a few seconds, is worse when coughing or lying down, and improves when leaning forward. The patient rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes feels it radiate to the neck. There are no other symptoms such as shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitations, or recent injuries. The patient recently recovered from the flu but currently has no viral symptoms. Family history is significant for the fatherâ€™s recent fatal heart attack. The patient occasionally drinks alcohol, does not smoke or use recreational drugs, and has no allergies or past medical conditions. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate the heart and reassures the patient while emphasizing further assessment.
