# Notes from Claude
I've created the result.md file with a comprehensive code review of the provided snippet from three expert perspectives:
Developer Perspective: Focuses on code structure, best practices, and provides an improved implementation with type hints, docstrings, and proper error handling.
Security Engineer Perspective: Highlights data validation issues, authentication concerns, and provides recommendations including email validation and proper logging.
Performance Specialist Perspective: Analyzes efficiency issues, scalability challenges, and offers an implementation using batch processing and memory-efficient data handling for larger datasets.
Each section includes specific, actionable recommendations with sample code implementations.
